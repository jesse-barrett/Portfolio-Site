                    I'm from a small town in southern Indiana called Versailles, and until I started college I'd lived
                    there
                    my whole life with my family who I love very much. I aim to bring the type of hospitality I've come
                    to
                    know from home to the table in the professional world.

                    I'm looking forward to starting my career in web development soon, and I'm on the hunt
                    for internships and other opportunities to develop my skills.
